A simple announcement program built in Godot. The idea orginated in our local computer science club having trouble getting the word out on our meeting schedules, the groups are scattered across multiple media platforms. My idea is to make it easy to get the word out for the most common forms of communications in the cs clubs ie: Slack, Discord, text.
